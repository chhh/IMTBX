# IMTBX (+Grppr)
**IMTBX (Ion Mobility Toolbox)** - 2D signal extraction tools for ion-mobility
coupled mass-spectrometry.  
**Grppr (Grouper)** - 2D isotopic clustering. Takes input from IMTBX to produce
isotopic envelopes with accurate predictions of monoisotopic mass even when
the monoisotopic peak is not visible.
