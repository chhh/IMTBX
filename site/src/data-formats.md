# Supported data formats
Currently we only fully support data from Waters' ion mobility equipped
instruments (`.raw` directories). However the API is rather generic, so
inclusion of support for other formats is possible.

**We are currently working on integrating Bruker (PASEF) and Agilent file formats.**

If you have data that you think is similar and want to try it out,
**please leave a ticket [in the issue tracker](https://github.com/chhh/IMTBX/issues)**.
We will try to accommodate your data format.
